    We hope you know about the ancient game <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess">Chess</a>.
    The ancient humans loved this game and our Robots trying to examine all tricks about chess too.
    Today they are solving the 8-queen problem from the old chess manuscript.
</p>

<p>
    Chess is a two-player strategy board game played on a chessboard,
    a checkered gameboard with 64 squares arranged in an eight-by-eight grid.
    Chess is played on a square board of eight rows (called ranks and denoted with numbers 1 to 8)
    and eight columns (called files and denoted with letters a to h) of squares.
    Each square of the chessboard is identified by a unique coordinate pair — a letter and a number (ex, "a1", "h8", "d6").
    For this mission we need to know only about queens.
    The queen can move any number of squares along rank, file, or diagonal.
</p>
<p>
    You should place eight chess queens on an 8×8 chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other.
    But we already placed one or several queens, so you need to finish the placement.
</p>

<p>
    You are given a set of square coordinates where queens are placed already.
    You should finish this set and return the full set of the square coordinates for Eight Queens.
    If it's not possible -- return an empty set.<br>
    Be careful - an initial position can contain threaten figures already.

    <strong>How it is used: </strong>
    This is a classical puzzle and combinatorial constrains problem.
    It can be useful if you need make a schedule for teachers or sport games in several stadiums.
